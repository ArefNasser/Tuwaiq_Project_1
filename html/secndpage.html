                    due to its strategic position and difficulty in reaching it, with a height of approximately 450
                    meters, and it remained as it is until the Yemenis were defeated by the Saudi army led by King Saud
                    And King Faisal, as a result of the Taif Agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, which ended the
                    aggressions between the two parties. Roum Castle remained as a security control point for security
                    patrols until 1372 AH, after which it turned into a tourist and archaeological landmark.</p>

                <h1>Najran</h1>
                <p>Najran is a city in southwestern Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen. It is the capital of Najran
                    Province. Designated as a new town, Najran is one of the fastest-growing cities in the kingdom; its
                    population has risen from 47,500 in 1974 and 90,983 in 1992 to 246,880 in 2004 and 505,652 in 2017.
                    The population mostly originates from the ancient tribes of Yām, Mákram, and Hamdan. Najranis are
                    Muslims, with Shia, Ismaili forming the plurality of the religious adherents. Hanbali, Shafi'i, and
                    Maliki Sunnis form the second-largest religious group in the city, while the Zaydi Shia form the
                    smallest religious group.

                    The Arabic term Najrān has at least two meanings: both the wooden frame on which a door opens and
                    also 'thirsty'. Local tradition also has it that the land derived its name from the first man to
                    settle in the area, Najran ibn Zaydan ibn Saba ibn Yahjub ibn Yarub ibn Qahtan.

                    Najran was the Yemeni centre of cloth making and originally, the kiswah or the cloth of the Ka'aba
                    was made there (the clothing of the Kaba first started by the Yemeni kings of Saba). There used to
                    be a Jewish community at Najran, renowned for the garments they manufactured. According to Yemenite
                    Jewish tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the Ten Tribes. Najran was also an
                    important stopping place on the Incense Route..</p>
